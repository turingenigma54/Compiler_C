# C Compiler Project

This is a simple compiler written in C and it processes a small language. It can be used with basic variables, print statements and arithmetics.

## Components

- **Lexing:** Helps convert raw source code into tokens.
- **Parsing:** Uses a recursive descent parser to parse the tokens generated by lexer.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluates the ATS directly, which enables us to run simple programs without seperate code
- **Control Flow:** Supports `if/else` and `while` statements.
- **Basic FizzBuzz:** You can run the classic FizzBuzz program in this custom language.

## Building and  Running

From the project root, run the following commands:


mkdir build
gcc -g ./src/*.c -o ./build/my_compiler.exe

Once built, run the following command:

./build/my_compiler.exe
